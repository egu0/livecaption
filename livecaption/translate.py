"""Translation thread: mlx-lm + Hy-MT2, translating finalized sentences serially.

By design only ASR's finalized sentences are translated, never the partials -- a
finalized sentence arriving a second or two late is fine, whereas partials change
constantly, so translating them wastes compute and makes the terminal flicker.
Translation backpressure must never stall audio. Generation goes through
stream_generate and acquires runtime.MLX_LOCK on each decode step: this serializes
all mx evaluation against ASR (MLX gives no guarantees for concurrent evaluation
across threads) while keeping a single translation from freezing the partial for
seconds.
