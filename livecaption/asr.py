"""Streaming ASR: mlx-audio nemotron-3.5 transducer (Apple GPU / MLX) + Silero VAD endpointing.

mlx-audio's stream_generate is pull-based (you hand it a whole audio segment, it
chunks internally and yields incremental results), so it can't be fed a live mic
stream. Here we reuse its cache-aware streaming kernel (streaming._stream_block) and
rewrite the outer loop into a push-based stepper (_StreamingEncoder): the bookkeeping
mirrors stream_encode line by line, guaranteeing the streaming output matches the
offline generate. Endpointing reimplements sherpa-onnx's rule1/2/3 semantics on top of
Silero VAD's per-frame speech probability (thresholds in config). Silence never enters
the encoder—the GPU only burns while someone is speaking. Speaker diarization
(Sortformer) attributes the whole utterance at finalization: the sentence is split by
token timestamps and each speaker's slice is emitted as a separate final, while during
partials a read-only peek assigns a provisional S label (see the comments on
_attribute_speakers / _diar_peek).

Note: the _stream_block and stream_encode bookkeeping is mlx-audio internal
implementation; pyproject already pins "mlx-audio>=0.4.4,<0.5". Before upgrading, run
scripts/smoke_asr.py to verify the streaming/offline results still match.
