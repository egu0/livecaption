#   Much stronger Chinese (+ Cantonese / code-switching), context-bias friendly. Its
#   streaming path emits no token timestamps, so partials refresh per chunk
#   (~QWEN_CHUNK_SIZE_SEC) rather than per word and carry no live speaker label; diarization
#   is utterance-level by default (one speaker per sentence), upgraded to nemotron-style
#   mid-sentence split only when QWEN_WORD_DIARIZE is on (see below).

# Word-level diarization for the qwen3 backend (parity with nemotron's mid-sentence speaker

# return_timestamps=True, each aligned word is mapped to a Sortformer frame speaker, and the
# text is sliced at speaker-change word boundaries into one final per speaker. On by default
# (the qwen3 backend's diarization is only worth much with it), at the cost of a per-utterance
# forced-alignment pass + an extra ~0.6B model (DEFAULT_QWEN_ALIGNER_MODEL). Disable with
# --no-qwen-word-diarize to fall back to utterance-level (one speaker per sentence) -- the

# at the next decoded sentence-final punctuation WITHOUT waiting for silence: the audio
# is split retroactively at the punctuation token's timestamp and the remainder (decode
# look-ahead that may already hold the next sentence's onset) carries over into the next
# utterance, so nothing is clipped. (A silence-based escalation can't work here: the
